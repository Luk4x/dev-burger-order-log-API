## About
This project is an API that performs the registration of orders for a hamburger shop, serving as the basis for the [Interface](https://github.com/Luk4x/dev-burger-order-log-interface) I built.

### Routes
-   `POST /order`: This route receives the customer's order, the customer's name, and the order amount. This information is passed by the `body` of the request, and based on it a new request is registered inside an array, in the following format:
    
    ```js
    {
      id: "ac3ebf68-e0ad-4c1d-9822-ff1b849589a8",
      order: "X- Salada, 2 batatas grandes, 1 coca-cola",
      clientName:"JosÃ©",
      price: 44.50,
      status: "Em preparaÃ§Ã£o"
    }
    ```

  The `id` and `status` information is generated in the system and incorporated in the request. The ids are generated using the `uuid` library, and the status is always 'In preparation' when an order is placed.<br>
    This route also has a special check to prevent orders with incomplete data from being made.

-   `GET /order`: This route lists all orders already placed, displaying the ones inside the array.

-   `GET /order/:id`: Based on the `id` sent, this route returns a specific request.

-   `PUT /order/:id`: Based on the `id` sent, this route can change an order, which could be one or all of the order data (except the `id` and `status`, of course).

-   `PATCH /order/:id`: Based on the `id` sent, once called this route changes the status of the received order to "Ready".

-   `DELETE /order/:id`:  Based on the `id` sent, once called, delete the received order.

#### Examples
When calling the `POST /order` route passing `{ order: "X- Salad, 2 large potatoes, 1 coke", clienteName:"JosÃ©", price: 44.50 }`, the array looks like this:

```js
[
    {
        id: 'ac3ebf68-e0ad-4c1d-9822-ff1b849589a8',
        order: 'X- Salada, 2 batatas grandes, 1 coca-cola',
        clienteName: 'JosÃ©',
        price: 44.5,
        status: 'Em preparaÃ§Ã£o'
    }
];
```

When calling the `PATCH /order/ac3ebf68-e0ad-4c1d-9822-ff1b849589a8` route, the array looks like this:

```js
[
    {
        id: 'ac3ebf68-e0ad-4c1d-9822-ff1b849589a8',
        order: 'X- Salada, 2 batatas grandes, 1 coca-cola',
        clienteName: 'JosÃ©',
        price: 44.5,
        status: 'Pronto'
    }
];
```

### Middlewares
- `checkIdExistence`: Its function is to check if the received ID exists and to take action if it does not. It is used on all routes that are given an ID.

- `showMethodNUrl`: Its function is to show the method (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE, etc) on the console and also the url of the request. It is used in all requests.

- `verifyClientData`: Its function is to verify the customer data sent by the `body`, and take action if this request intends to modify data that the customer does not have permission to.
